1. x-data="{ open: false }"': It creates a variable named open and sets it to false (dropdown hidden by default).
let open = false;

2. @click="open = !open"

This runs when the button is clicked.

If open = false → dropdown opens

If open = true → dropdown closes

3. @click.outside="open = false" : If the user clicks anywhere outside the component, the dropdown automatically closes.
